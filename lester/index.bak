<h2>The Lester Family Genealogy</h2>


<p>This site represents the current status of my research into the history of the Lester family of Nottingham, England.
</p>

<p>Thus far I have gathered details of <a href="directory/surnames.html">162 individuals in 62 families</a> and the earliest record I have is that of <a href="tree/I120.html">Richard Lester</a> (Lister) and his wife Rosamond whose childrren were baptised at Nottingham St. Mary's in the early part of the 18th century.
</p>

<p>Many of the Lesters were employed in the thriving Nottingham lace factories of the 19th and 20th centuries and it was the lace trade which took <a href="tree/I32.html">John Lester</a> to Naples, Italy in c1857 (where his son <a href="tree/I28.html">Frederick</a> was born). Later (c1880), both John and Frederick were to be found in Germany with their familes.
</p>

<p>For the most part, I have supporting documentation for the information in this tree in the form of birth and marriage certificates, census returns and transcripts of parish records.</p>
