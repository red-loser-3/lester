<h2>The Anstee Family Genealogy</h2>

<div class='intro'>

<h4>Navigating the Site</h4>

<p>The <a href="directory/surnames.html">Directory Page</a> summarizes all the family names held in the tree, each link giving rise to a list of individuals. Clicking on an individual's name will bring up that part of the tree containing details of their parents, grandparents, spouse and children. Each of these names are themselves links to other parts of the tree. There is also an indication of how many more generations are in the tree for each descendant and ancestor shown.</p>

<h4>Relationship Calculator</h4>

<p>A link called 'Relatives' is available on all individual pages as well as from each surname page on the Directory. Clicking this link will show the relationship between the individual concerned and every other blood-related person in the tree.</p>
