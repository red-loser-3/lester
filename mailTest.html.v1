<h2>The Lester Family Genealogy</h2>

<div class='intro'>
<p>This site represents the current status of my research into the history of the Lester family of Nottingham, England.
</p>

<p>Thus far I have gathered details of <a href="directory/surnames.html">162 individuals in 62 families</a> and the earliest record I have is that of <a href="tree/I120.html">Richard Lester</a> (Lister) and his wife Rosamond whose children were baptised at Nottingham St. Mary's in the early part of the 18th century.
</p>

<p>Many of the Lesters were employed in the thriving Nottingham lace factories of the 19th and 20th centuries and it was the lace trade which took <a href="tree/I32.html">John Lester</a> to Naples, Italy in c1857 (where his son <a href="tree/I28.html">Frederick</a> was born). Later (c1880), both John and Frederick were also to be found in Germany with their familes.
</p>

<p>For the most part, I have supporting documentation for the information in this tree in the form of birth and marriage certificates, census returns and transcripts of parish records.</p>

<h3>Navigating the Site</h3>

<p>The <a href="directory/surnames.html">Directory Page</a> summarizes all the family names held in the tree, each link giving rise to a list of individuals. Clicking on an individual's name will bring up that part of the tree containing details of their parents, grandparents, spouse and children. Each of these names are themselves links to other parts of the tree. There is also an indication of how many more generations are in the tree for each descendant and ancestor shown.</p>

<h4>Relationship Calculator</h4>

<p>A link called 'Relatives' is available on all individual pages as well as from each surname page on the Directory. Clicking this link will show the relationship between the individual concerned and every other blood-related person in the tree.</p>
